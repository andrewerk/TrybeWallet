# Application

This project was developed during my studies at trybe, on the frontend module. The purpose of the application is to build a portfolio of expenses, which can be added in several different currencies, obtained by an API. Added expenses can be deleted and edited, a process in which it is possible to assign new properties to the expense to be edited.

The application shows the total spend, which automatically updates as a new spend is added, updated, or removed.
